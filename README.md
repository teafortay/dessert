Fetch take-home

by Taylor Shaw (teafortay)
I completed this project over the last weekend in April 2023. Thank you for the assignment; I had a lot of fun doing it!

Notes: 
- I used MVvM architecture and SwiftUI.
- I used AsyncImage instead of an UIImage extension. AsyncImage is from iOS 15, and it does the data caching under the hood. Here are the docs for AsyncImage: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/asyncimage
